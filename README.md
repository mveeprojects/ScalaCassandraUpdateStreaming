# Scala Cassandra Update Streaming

Codebase exploring how to read the contents of a table in Cassandra, and then update records based on a simple condition.

This example is based off of the Baeldung "videos" example linked below. My extension of this is simply to read in the 
contents of the `video` table in Cassandra, convert the video titles to lowercase and write them back to the same table.

### Instructions

1. Start up Cassandra by running `./docker/vanilladockercassandra.sh`from the root of this project.
2. Wait about 20 seconds (until Cassandra is ready)*.
3. Run [Main](src/main/scala/Main.scala) from IntelliJ.

[*] I'm experiencing some sbt issues at the moment, this will be handled in a more elegant manner via the docker-compose healthcheck api or similar.
